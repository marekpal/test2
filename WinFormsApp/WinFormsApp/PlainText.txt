(CNN) A Russian-built Antonov-12 transport plane crashed Wednesday shortly after takeoff from the airport in Juba, South Sudan, killing 15 people, a South Sudanese presidential spokesman told CNN.

Eighteen people were aboard the flight: 12 South Sudanese passengers and six crew members -- five Armenians and one Russian -- said Ateny Wek Ateny, a press secretary in the South Sudan President's office. Three people survived: two South Sudanese passengers and an infant boy less than a year old, Ateny said.
